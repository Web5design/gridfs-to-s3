# MongoDB GridFS -> Amazon S3 backup / restore script

## Backup

Backup (GridFS -> S3) is roughly ordered by insertion date. MongoDB's `ObjectId` contains a timestamp in its most significant bytes.

## Restore

Restore (S3 -> GridFS) is ordered by lexicographical order, e.g.:

    1
    10
    100
    2
    20
    200
    ...
